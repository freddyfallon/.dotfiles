# My dotfiles

## My Vim config

### Installation

Copy the contents of `.vimrc` into your own `.vimrc` at the root of your home directory.

You will also need the following:

1. [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug): Follow the instructions on the GitHub repo's README
2. [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher): Again, follow the install instructions in the repo's README.

Once you have the two items above, simply open up a Vim session and type:

```
:PlugInstall
```

You should also copy the contents of `/themes` into your `.vim/colors` directory.

Now everything should work great.

## My .zshrc

Simply copy the contents of the `.zshrc` into yours and it should be all good.
